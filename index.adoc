== Tutorials

=== GR8 CRM Web Site

link:/tutorials/gr8crm-web/index.html[This guide] describes how you can use
GR8 CRM Grails plugins to develop a simple web site.
The link:plugins/crm-content/index.html[crm-content] plugin makes it possible to add HTML pages in a content repository and make the pages publicly accessible.

In this tutorial you will create a Grails application that can serve as a public facing web site. It will have built-in content editing features,
including image uploads.

== Demo applications

This section show demo applications based on {gr8crm} plugins.

=== GR8 CRM To-Do

https://github.com/technipelago/gr8crm-demo-app[This Grails application] uses {gr8crm} plugins to create a simple Contact Management and To-Do application. Clone it and run it, you will have it up and running in a minute or two.

=== GR8 Contact

The https://github.com/gr8crm/gr8contact[GR8 Contact] application
is a simple Contact Management application. It was initially presented at
GR8Conf Europe 2014 by https://github.com/goeh[Göran Ehrsson] (https://twitter.com/goeh[@goeh]).
The github repository contains 5 branches, each representing a snapshot in time during development.

- *master* A plain Grails application, created with grails create-app
- *m1* The plugin link:plugins/crm-contact-ui/index.html[crm-contact-ui] was installed and contact (company/person) CRUD features are available.
- *m2* The plugin link:plugins/crm-content-ui/index.html[crm-content-ui] was installed and documents/files can now be attached to contacts.
- *m3* The plugin link:plugins/crm-task-ui/index.html[crm-task-ui] was installed and tasks/appointments with contacts can now be scheduled.
- *m4* The plugin cookie-layout was installed and two themes were created to show that UI can change depending on sub-domain.

TIP: Four more branches was added for the *Greach 2015* demo.

- *m1-greach*: Same as **m1** but with Greach theme applied.

- *m2-greach*: Same as **m2** but with Greach theme applied.

- *m3-greach*: Same as **m3** but with Greach theme applied and option to import Greach 2015 speakers as contacts.

- *m4-greach*: Same as **m4** but with Greach theme available. Three themes (Greach, Gr8ConfEU and Gr8ConfUS) available at run-time.

=== GR8 CRM Web Site

A sample application that was created by following the *GR8 CRM Web Site*
tutorial (see above) can be found at https://github.com/gr8crm/gr8crm-web

== Application Events

Most {gr8crm} plugins use application events (synchronous and asynchronous)
to communicate with the host application and other {gr8crm} plugins.
In link:events.html[this document] you can read about some examples where
application events are used in {gr8crm} applications.
Looking at all these examples you get an understanding of how to think
when designing "modular monoliths" with {gr8crm}.
